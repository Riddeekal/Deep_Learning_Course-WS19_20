# Deep_Learning_Course_WS19_20
This repository contains all assignment submissions for the Deep Learning Course in the Winter Semester 2019/2020.

This course is a graduate course and is part of the electives of the Masters Program in Research in Computer and Systems Engineering (RCSE) MSc. Program at the Technische Universität Ilmenau (TU Ilmenau).

The WS19/20 batch is the first cohort taking this course and i am so excited to be taking this course with Prof. Mader. 

Course Instructors: 
* [Prof. Dr. Patrick Mäder (JP)](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/secsy/lehre/): Head of Department - Software Technology for Safety-Critical Systems Group, TU-Ilmenau
* [Dr. rer. nat. Marco Seeland](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/secsy/team/marco-seeland/) TU-Ilmenau.

"Deep learning has recently revolutionized a variety of applications like speech recognition, image classification, and language translation. Deep learning thereby refers to a subset of machine learning algorithms that analyze data in succeeding stages, each operating on a different representation of the analyzed data. Specific to deep learning is the ability to automatically learn these representations rather than relying on domain expert for defining them manually. This course will give you detailed insight into deep learning, introducing you to the fundamentals as well as to the latest tools and methods in this rapidly emerging field. The course will teach you the theoretical foundations of deep neural networks, which will provide you with the understanding necessary for adapting and successfully applying deep learning in your own applications. Additionally, by completing the course, you will be able to implement, parametrize and apply a variety of deep learning algorithms. You will learn how to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as well as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for image, text, and time series analysis. You will further become familiar with advanced data science tools and in using computational resources to train and apply deep learning models."
